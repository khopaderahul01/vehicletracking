Real Time Vehicle Tracking and Traffic Analysis 

A definite and robust vehicle detection and tracking
system is one of the key modules for intelligent vehicles to grasp
the surrounding environment. Now-a- days, Traffic congestion is
also the major problem in the whole world. So in order to reduce
traffic in the city and track the vehicle a traffic surveillance
system is proposed. Global positioning system is becoming
popular for tracking the vehicle. The vehicle tracking system uses
the GPS module to get geographic coordinates at regular time
intervals. In this paper we proposed hybrid and novel system
which concurrently gives the location of vehicle with flow of on
road traffic. Using GPS kit we will detect parameters like Speed,
Latitude, Longitude, Path of the vehicle etc. Video camera is a
favourable traffic sensor because of its low cost and its potential
ability to collect a large amount of information. The system
involves analysis a sequence of road images which represent the
flow of traffic for the given time period and place.
